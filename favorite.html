        I use the kitchen to de-stress. It was something that really helped my anxiety during the pandemic and it still helps to this day. 
        Eating the goods I make was never that important to me, but it was who I made it for. My family and friends enjoy what I make and it makes me really happy to see that I could make someone else happy.
